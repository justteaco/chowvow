# Software Engineering Immersive: Project 3

This is my third project built while at General Assembly as a Software Engineering Immersive Student. It was a 7 day paired programming project. 




# Chow Vow 

Chow Vow is an app for members to trade skills and search for other chefs from anywhere in the world. The user can view the map or list of members with any kind of cooking skills. If clicked on a member, the user is redirected to the login page. 
The users can search via location or skills to connect with other members.

## Timeframe

7 days


## Tech Stack 

Built with:

* Mapbox API
* Git and Github
* React
* Node.js
* Mongoose & MongoDB
* Express.js
* SCSS
* Axios
* Dot ENV
* Mocha & Chai
* Insomnia 
* Z Shell 
* JWT
* Yarn 
* Heroku

## Release History

* Will not be updating this app. I wanted to show the challenges that I came across building it in the 7 day timeframe given. This is also being used as a benchmark to show where I started to where I am today. This app was made on week 6.

Even when the user is not logged in, they are able to browse the site. They can look through the skills and the map to see the location of the current members. The marker displays the members profile image, skills, rating and a link for the members to collaborate.Once they've clicked on a profile, they are redirected to register/login. Then the member can register and upload a profile picture and then login.

Once the memeber decides that they want to trade skills with another member they can request to trade and then can click on the offers page to see who has reuqested to trade with them. They can accept offers and emails for them to go forward with the collaboraation or they can ignore and delete.

If the user/member is looking for a specific skill they can search for them on the home page or from the drop down menu on the navbar under 'Chefs'.

# Project Managment



* Day 1: brainstorming the look and plan of app.  

* Days 2-3: planned backend foundations, our Idea, and where we wanted to be with MVP.  Wire-framed the pages and mapped out the memebers journey. As a group we implemented the backend and started on frontend.

* Days 4-5: split the pages between the four of us and focused on functionality

* Days 5-7:  design, and usability, and presentation.

* We used Trello to plan and keep on top of our to-do's. We would have a "stand up" and talk about our trials and errors from the day before, how we could help each other on our perosnal assignments, and what needs to be done by the end of that day. 


## Division Of Work 

Backend: 
* Auth and User controllers - Login and Register. 
* Seeds 
* User Models 

Frontend: 
* Login 
* Register
* Edit Page
* Show Page
* Styling 




# Challenges and Improvements
## Challenges:

The biggest setback during our group project was trying to synchronize our work to Git. Every day there was another issue and loads of errors that took up a good chunk of our work time. In this time we learned how to effectively communicate with each other and work seamlessly through our mistakes. At some point we all pushed our work incorrectly which got rid of some of our work which was the biggest issue.

## Improvements 

A future improvement would be implementing a live chat with the members so that can communicate effeciently. For things like discussing meet ups, specific locations, and sharinf recipes and quick tips. We also wante to build in a section for people create recipes and share on their profiles. We want to include an option for members to secure their passwords and image upload on the edit page. 

## Successes and Key Learnings

I really enjoyed working on the Auth and user controllers. Making sure the login and register page were secured and functional on both frontend and backend. Also working with a diveresed set of people allowed me to see how I compliment everyones strengths and weaknesses. Executing a plan in a short period of time also helped us accomplish task with effectively. We learned how to task ourselves by what's important and what's neccsarry..
